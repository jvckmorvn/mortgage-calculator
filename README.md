## Introduction

This is a lightweight mortgage calculator app built to practice Java fundamentals like classes, methods, loops etc. The user is prompted for a principal value, an annual interest rate, and a time period (in years), and uses these values to calculate and display the user's monthly mortgage repayments, along with a payment schedule that shows what the outstanding balance will be following each payment until the mortgage has been paid off.
