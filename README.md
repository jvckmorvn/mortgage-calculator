## Introduction

This is a lightweight mortgage calculator app built to practice Java fundamentals like classes, methods, loops etc. The user is prompted for a principal value, APR, and time period (in years) and uses this to calculate the value of their monthly mortgage repayments, along with a payment schedule that displays what the outstanding balance will be following each payment until the mortgage has been paid off.
